Today we learned about ROT 13 and the importance of looking at issues from all angles. In the end, we tried to learn how to say "we are initiated" in ASL; however, we ran out of time.

Today we learned the basics of terminal by exploring file organization and commands to navigative through the files. Additionally, we learned about feasability studies. Regarding file organization, we learned about commands such as ls and cd. 

Today we read about deepfakes and practiced our use of bash programs to increase our comprehension. We printed our names and learned to use mathmatical equations and variables. We also created programs to convert fahrenheit to celcius and bitcoin to USD. At the end of class, we linked our GitHub journal with our CompSci folder.

Today we learned more about Bash and used the language to begin creating more complex programs. We made a program which checked to see whether an inputted number was within a range and we created a script which confirmed if login credentials were correct or not. On top of that, we began work on a "ramen problem" which simulated a menu ordering system.

Today we read about SaaS (software as a service) and the impact that it is having on the world. Later on in class, we were assigned to create a game while effectively harnessed if-else statements to create a story. We finished this game as homework.

Today, Wednesday, September 11th, we learned about while loops. They can be harnessed to repeat infinitely or they can be broken after a certain condition is met. We also worked further on our game to try and refine it a bit more.
